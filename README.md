<h1>X-Hypem</h1>

Update: Hypem.com has currently changed some of their code. I am currently working on X-hypem to bring it back online.

This script downloads every song from the 'latest' section of hypem.com. 

Install
----------
<ul>
X-Hypem is a perl script that requires the following modules:
<li>JSON</li>
<li>LWP::UserAgent</li>
<li>use MP3::Tag</li>
</ul>
You can install these modules with the following command using cpanm:

<code>cpanm --sudo LWP::UserAgent JSON MP3::Tag</code>

Usage
----------
X-Hypem will run with no parameters, ie:

<code>perl x-hypem.pl</code>

Additional:
